# PRP_Robot_Kinematics_Dynamics
Symbolic computation and numerical simulation of the kinematics, the inverse kinematics and the dynamics of a PRP robotic arm.
The kinematics equations are found using vector calculus instead of the skew theory.
And the dynamics equations are found using two methods: iterative Newton-Euler; and Gibs-Appel by Kane's method.
